1. Which of the following sorting algorithms uses recursion

Quick Sort


2. Tell me about the difference between private and public variable/methods

Public classes can be modified outside of the class; you can access the members from anywhere within the program . Private can't be directly modified, accessed, or viewed outside of the class.


3. Which of the sorting algorithms discussed is like the natural way of organizing the cards in your hand? 

Insertion Sort


4. What does the output of this code look like?

/*
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct node{
	int data = 0;
	node *next = NULL;
};

int main(){
	node *first = new node;
	node *second = new node;
	first -> next = second;
	second -> data = 2;
	cout << second -> data << endl;
	return 0;
}
*/

{0,pointer to node} -> {2, NULL}


5. Write the code (just the Node struct) for a singly linked list of integers, then put the additional line(s) of code in a comment if we wanted to make it a doubly linked list.

Use the variable names data, prev, and next.

ex:
struct node{ 
//everything goes in here
// //double comment to suggest what goes in a doubly-linked list
};

struct Node{
     int key;
     Node *next = NULL;
//     Node *previous = NULL;
};
