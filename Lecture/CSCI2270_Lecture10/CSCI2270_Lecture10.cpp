/* BINARY SEARCH TREES

Binary tree
- root - is the base and has branches, first node that has children but not parents
- parent
- child

using base 2 allows a yes/no 1/0 response based on a threshold

degree - number of subtrees of a node is called degrees
leaf node - nodes that degree 0
degree of a tree - maximum of the degerees of all the nodes
ancestors -all the nodes along the path from root to that node
level - level of the root is assumed to be 1 or 0. If a node is at level 1
then its children are at level 1+1

first element pushed in is the root

search by halving the set
make accessible only convenient methods (ADT)
computationally efficient
recursion/iterative

balanced vs. unbalanced
balanced - even number of elements on both sides
